Our pipeline also provides a practical strategy for bootstrapping resources for other Chinese dialects.

A major problem is that despite that Linux is typically considered to be lighter, it actually has worse power consumption. Even with utilities like TLP, it is not very ideal.\n\nFor years, MacBooks have been famous for their extraordinary battery life, especially after the release of Apple Silicon (M-series chips) in ARM architecture. [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org/) is a project that brings Linux to Apple Silicon Macs. Plus, it is also the setup Linus Torvalds uses.\n\nThis is why I bought an M2 MacBook Air in 2025. I got a 24+512GB one at a pretty fair price of about CN¥6,000. M2 still has around 70% of M4's performance, so it would be very sufficient for daily use.\n\nAsahi Linux officially co-operates with Fedora and releases Fedora Asahi Remix as an officially-polished, flagship distro with a maximal support for drivers and stability. This is also the version I installed.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis is where things get wild. It is the easiest (and also fastest) Linux installation I have gone through. The only thing needed is this command in macOS terminal:\n```sh\ncurl https://alx.sh | sh\n```\nOr, alternatively, use\n```sh\ncurl https://fedora-asahi-remix.org/install | sh\n```\nto have Fedora logos and branding.\n\nThe shell script wizard is quite simple with clear instructions and explanations. Since I am more used to GNOME, I selected Fedora Asahi Remix on GNOME (in contrary to their flagship release in KDE Plasma).\n\nMacOS has to be kept (technically it can be removed, but this would make things more complicated). And since I am not entirely sure whether I am still going to occasionally rely on some apps not available on Linux (like Microsoft Office), I reserved 100GB for macOS. This is very easy to configure in the wizard.\n\nThe installation finishes in a very short time. Then comes the first boot.\n\n## General experience\n\nI did not run into any trouble. After a rough test, the battery life is at least 10 hours, which is already beating almost all Linux laptops.\n\nThere are still some hardware features missing, like fingerprint sensor and external displays via USB-C. For me, those are not major issues as I barely use these functions any way on the laptop. The only problem is the lack of hardware video decoding that makes the device hot when playing videos. However, the software decoding is not laggy at all and still maintains a very low power consumption.\n\n## Customisations and solutions to some issues\n\n### Camera notch\n\nBy default, the entire camera notch area is excluded from the display area, which is definitely a waste of space, especially that GNOME has its own top panel.\n\nTo utilise this area, add a kernel parameter:\n```sh\nsudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args=\"apple_dcp.show_notch=1\"\n```\n\nGNOME places the date and time in the middle, which is then covered by the camera notch. [Just Perfection](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3843/just-perfection/) is a GNOME extension that allows modification. I moved date and time to the left of the panel.\n\nThe camera notch is about 60px high. With the extension, the panel height can also be adjusted to perfectly match it. With my display setting of 150% scaling, the height should be set to 40px.\n\n### Fractional scaling and Wayland\n\nIt is not very satisfactory to use X11 apps under Wayland with fractional scaling. It makes apps blurry.\n\nGNOME now comes with an experimental feature that allows native scaling in XWayland that can be enabled using:\n\n```sh\ngsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features \"['scale-monitor-framebuffer', 'xwayland-native-scaling']\"\n```\n\nN.B., `scale-monitor-framebuffer` must be turned on, or the scaling settings would not persist across boots.\n\n### Installing additional codecs\n\nWith the default free codecs, the experience of video playing is not good (lag and heat). Fedora offers [RPM Fusion](https://rpmfusion.org) to install these non-free software packages. First enable RPM Fusion:\n```sh\nsudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm\n```\nConfirm they are enabled with\n```sh\ndnf repolist | grep rpmfusion\n```\n\nInstall the multimedia codec group:\n```sh\nsudo dnf group install multimedia\n```\n\nFedora ships `ffmpeg-free`, which avoids some patented codecs. RPM Fusion provides a full build:\n```sh\nsudo dnf swap ffmpeg-free ffmpeg --allowerasing\n```\n\nThen to update it, run\n```sh\nsudo dnf update @multimedia --setopt=\"install_weak_deps=False\" --exclude=PackageKit-gstreamer-plugin\n```\n\nFinally reboot.\n\n### Volume and microphone\n\nThe sound volume always resets to 100% after login and I did not find a very decent solution. However, by changing volume using `alsamixer`, the value seems to persist.\n\nGNOME panel always reports that the microphone is in use (an orange indicator icon is shown). This is a recognised issue that currently does not have a solution.\n\n### Keyboard\n\nThere are kernel parameters that allow modification including:\n- swapping keys (`0` to disable and `1` to enable):\n\t- swapping control and command (`swap_ctrl_cmd`)\n\t- swapping fn and left control (`swap_fn_leftctrl`)\n\t- swapping option and command (`swap_opt_cmd`)\n- switching fn mode (`fnmode`; `1` for using the labelled functions and `2` for using F1--F12 keys)\n\nSet them using\n```sh\nsudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args=\"hid_apple.[PARAMETER]=[VALUE]\"\n```\n\n### À la Ubuntu\n\nFedora GNOME comes in a quite vanilla taste. I use the following to make it similar to an Ubuntu GNOME experience and functionalities.\n\n[Dash to Dock](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/) extension adds a dock to the GNOME Shell. [AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) adds tray icons to the panel (also, I like to set them completely to greyscale for a less disturbing appearance). [Tiling Assistant](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3733/tiling-assistant/) creates a Windows-like tiling pop-up interface.\n\nIn my opinion, Ubuntu's Yaru theme is better than GNOME's default Adwaita in terms of matching the curves of a MacBook. It is simple to install using the meta-package:\n```sh\nsudo dnf install yaru-theme\n```\nAnd, install the extension [User Themes](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/) to select it as the shell theme (so that it applies to the dock, panel, etc.). This does not conflict with (and does not change) the GTK3/4 styles. GTK3 themes can be set using GNOME Tweaks. GTK4 themes can only be installed using CSS replacements in config files.","blog/asahi.md","8eb8df2127903eca",{"html":53,"metadata":54},"\u003Cp>I have been using Linux as a daily driver for quite a while.
