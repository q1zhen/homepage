This is <dfn title="Hànyǔ Pīnyīn: Yáng Qízhēn&NewLine;Gwoyeu Romatzyh: Yang Chyi-Jen&NewLine;IPA: [jɑŋ³⁵ tɕʰi³⁵ ʈʂən⁵⁵]">**Yang Qizhen**</dfn> from Shanghai, China.

I speak Shanghainese, Mandarin, and English.

I am interested in linguistics, computer science, natural language processing (NLP), cryptocurrency, mathematics, anthropology, typography, ultimate frisbee, and visual arts.

Not only that, I am also a big fan of self-hosted services and [CorpFree](https://www.reddit.com/r/CorpFree/). I believe we should all expel intrusive corporation products that do not act in favour of us. Everyone should live a sustainable and private digital life and enjoy the right to be forgotten.
